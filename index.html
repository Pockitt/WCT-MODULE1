    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">You want to adopt good server-side web -frameworks and -configuration. This could be considered as your foundation so it needs to be secure and stable from the start.
      Always think about security from the start, and automate as much as you can, this helps your web security team maintain and develop further security measures down the road and leave less room for human error.
      Include all your employees in security practices. This is team effort, and everyone should feel responsibility over security as this is the best way to build secure software.
      You want to perform vulnerability scans and security tests (such as IAST/DAST/SAST checks) regularly to help spot weaknesses in your security as you go.
      Use parameterized queries where a user could input data to prevent SQLi attacks.
      Sanitize all user input, always! You can't let your web application trust any data from the web browser. Sanitize all user data before displaying it, or using it in SQL queries and file system calls.
      This prevents a whole array of attacks, such as XXS, DoS, CI, and FI. These are all different methods of gathering sensitive data about users and the system itself.
